# Gravitational-lensing- 
The goal of this problem was to investigate whether the desttibution of dark matter is Uniform distribution , or it there are Jupiters of dark matter by comparing the results of observed gravitatational lensing and modeled gravitational lensing where the contribution of dark matter is not taken into account . 

My part of this research was to write which took rays and counted their deviation after the passage of the cylinder with the stars . Taking the table stars.csv , then parsing in order to be able to work is it on C .
